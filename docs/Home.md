# Welcome to Xray-Lite Wiki

Xray-lite is a lightweight, high-performance VLESS + Reality proxy server implemented in pure Rust. It is designed for users who prioritize performance, memory efficiency, and advanced stealth capabilities.

## Architecture Highlights

- **Pure Rust Implementation**: High performance with memory safety.
- **Asymmetric Compatibility**: Works with standard Xray/V2Ray clients (v2rayNG, Shadowsocks-libev, etc.).
- **Kernel-Level Acceleration**: Uses eBPF (XDP/TC) for firewalling and traffic shaping (XDP Edition).
- **Stealth First**: Optimized for Reality and xhttp protocols to evade detection.

## Why Xray-Lite?

Unlike official Xray which handles everything in user-space, Xray-lite moves critical network operations into the Linux kernel (via XDP). This not only boosts performance by reducing context switching but also provides a "stealth" layer where certain probing packets are dropped before they even reach the application layer.
